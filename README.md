# Welcome to the course!

This is the `README` for the introductory assignment. For a step-by-step guide on how to complete this assignment and submit it for grading, please watch the video tutorial. This is an individual assignment so you should complete it by yourself (there will be a similar tutorial for team assignments later). That said, if you do get stuck with any of the technical aspects surrounding the assignment (access, editing, submission, etc.), see if one of your teammates can help you. If all else fails, please email the instructor for help.

## Setup

If you see this `README`, you have already successfully set up your GitHub account and accepted the assignment - hooray!

## Assignment

Fill out the questions in the `assignment.md` file by following along with the tutorial.

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, submit by creating a pull request with `submit` as the base branch and your instructor as the reviewer (follow the tutorial to learn how to do this).

## Grading

This assignment will be graded based solely on completeness (i.e. if you fill out all questions and submit it in time you get full marks). See the syllabus for information on the late policy for this class.
