# Welcome to the course!

This is the `README` for the introductory assignment. For a step-by-step guide on how to complete this assignment and submit it for grading, please watch the video tutorial. This is an individual assignment so you should complete it by yourself (there will be a similar tutorial for team assignments later). That said, if you do get stuck with any of the technical aspects surrounding the assignment (access, editing, submission, etc.), see if one of your teammates can help you. If all else fails, please email the instructor for help.

## Setup

If you see this `README`, you have already successfully set up your GitHub account and accepted the assignment - hooray!

You can complete the entire assignment online on GitHub if you prefer to work from your browser, or do not have access to a computer where you can install new programs. If you prefer to work locally on your computer and have the necessary administrative privileges to install new programs, it is recommended to use [**GitHubDesktop**](https://desktop.github.com/) to synchronize your local work with your GitHub account, and the text editor [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) for editing the assignment. GitHubDesktop and Atom are the recommended tools for this class and their installation and setup are described below and in the video tutorial. That said, if you already have a text editor you really like and/or you are an expert at synchronizing your work with GitHub without a user interface, you're very welcome to continue with what you already know.

## Assignment

Fill out the questions in the `assignment.md` file by following along with the tutorial.

## Submission

Once you have completed the assignment, submit by creating a pull request with `submit` as the base branch and your instructor as the reviewer (follow the tutorial to learn how to do this).

## Grading

This assignment will be graded based solely on completeness (i.e. if you fill out all questions and submit it in time you get full marks). See the syllabus for information on the late policy for this class.
